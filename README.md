# Microsoft 365 DevDays ExportingDataOpenXML Workshop

## Exporting Data using Microsoft Graph, OXML, and SDK Office Add-ins

In this repo you'll find the working solution code for the tutorial in: 

[Exporting Data with OpenXML](https://github.com/InteropEvents/ExportingDataWithOpenXMLTutorial)

## What the code does

The code is generated initially by the Open XML SDK Productivity Tool. This reflects C# code from a template document. This provides the base from which customizations can be made.

The worksheet generation is modified using snippets in this tutorial to build a table from Microsoft Graph generated JSON data.

Finally, the worksheet generation code is modified to "pin" (auto open) an Excel JS add-in to the workbook.

Please refer to the tutorial (linked above) for more details.
